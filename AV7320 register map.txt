ROM: 0 - BFFF
	Can't modify
	Also has its own checksum

SFR space that doesn't contain a register is unwritable
	Could use this as a method to detect unused registers

RAM probably ends at EFFF (12KiB)

F051-F050
	ISR address

F060-F061
	Probably 'interrupt' enable bits
	A bit is asserted in the headset ROM for every 2 function pointers written

F095-F094
	ISR address

F09B-F09A
	ISR address

F0B0, F0B2
	Related to headset volume wheel

F0E1, F0E2

F0F4

F100
	GPIO input data 0 (GPIO0-GPIO7)
F101
	GPIO input data 1
F102
	GPIO output 0
F103
	GPIO output 1
F104
	GPIO direction 0
F105
	GPIO direction 1

F106, F107, F108, F109, F10A, F10B

F10C
	related to GPIO input data
	Copied to 0xE7EC
F10D
	related to GPIO input data
	Copied to 0xE7ED
F10E
	Set up to be 0x40 on boot for the button
	Could be interrupt, pullup, input enable
F10F
	Set up to be 0x00 on boot
	Could be interrupt, pullup, input enable

F180
	headset

F211
	headset
	Mic doesn't work without this having the '4' bit set

F280
	Headset. Controls some aspects of the mic
		'2' bit causes no output if set, unless '1' is also set
		'4' bit enables a steep LPF
		'8' bit enables the fade in/out
		'20' bit causes the blue LEDs to be the mic input
			Possibly this is a mode and there's another byte that describes the GPIO to select

F303, F30D, F310, F311
	headset

F500, F501
	headset sub_E672 only

F894
	Must be some kind of data output register because it's being loaded with data in the headset FW
	First byte loaded in is special

F9A2
	Probably data output register
F9A3
